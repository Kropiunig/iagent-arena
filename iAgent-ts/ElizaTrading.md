# Running with Trading System Prompts

This guide provides instructions for running the application with the new trading system prompts and includes example queries to test the enhanced capabilities.


## Example Trading Queries

### Basic Queries

These simple queries will help you get started with the trading features:

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `What's the current state of the BTC/USDT market?` | Basic market overview |
| `I want to buy 0.1 BTC at market price` | Simple trade execution |
| `Show me my open positions` | Account information |
| `What's the current price of ETH?` | Simple price check |
| `How has the Bitcoin market performed in the last 24 hours?` | Basic market analysis |

### Advanced Queries

These queries will test the more sophisticated aspects of the trading system prompt:

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `I'd like to open a long position on ETH/USDT with 3x leverage, using 20% of my available balance, and set a stop loss at 5% below entry` | Complex trade setup with risk management |
| `What position size should I use for a BTC short with 5x leverage if I'm willing to risk 2% of my $10,000 portfolio?` | Position sizing with risk parameters |
| `Analyze the current ETH/USDT market conditions and suggest entry points for a long position with target profit levels` | Market analysis with entry strategy |
| `Compare the risk/reward of going long on BTC versus ETH given the current market conditions` | Comparative analysis |
| `I have $5,000 in my account. Suggest how I should allocate it between BTC, ETH, and INJ for a balanced trading portfolio` | Portfolio optimization |
| `I have a long BTC position that's currently 10% in profit. Should I take profits now or set a trailing stop loss?` | Trade management |
| `What are the key indicators I should monitor for my INJ/USDT position, and what values would suggest exiting the trade?` | Technical analysis guidance |
| `Explain how I could implement a grid trading strategy for ETH/USDT on Injective with $3,000` | Trading strategy implementation |


## Expected Outcomes

The trading system prompt enhances responses in several key ways:

1. **Structured Analysis**: Responses follow a consistent pattern of analysis, risk assessment, and execution planning
2. **Safety First**: All recommendations emphasize proper risk management
3. **Market Standardization**: Market names and terminology are standardized (e.g., "BTC/USDT PERP" â†’ "btcusdt-perp")
4. **Explicit Verification**: Critical operations require clear confirmation steps
5. **Educational Content**: Responses explain concepts and implications of trading decisions
